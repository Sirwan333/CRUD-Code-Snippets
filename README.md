# A02 CRUD Code Snippets

1- I have used the MVC architecture in this assignment, where I put all the routes in the router folder, and then when a request is coming it is moving to the controller to decide which view it will take. I used the view engine to produce different views depending on the controller. In the model, I have two basic models one for snippet codes and the other for the users which are schemas in the database, and in the config folder, I have the connection and setting for the database. I think this structure is applicable for this assignment and it could do a good job even if the application scales up. 

2- I used the MongoDB database, I did not install the database I used the cloud version of it. I used mongoose to fill the gap between the application and the database and to start the connection. It was not hard to initialize the database. It was kind of straightforward when fetching, creating, or deleting from the database. I have used MySql in a previous course but I think it is completely different from the documents database like MongoDB. 

3- I am kind of satisfied with my application, and I could improve more when dealing with errors. I think the best thing in my application is the connection with the database and the CRUD functions. 

4- I have learned a lot during this assignment, and most importantly express and mongoose. I learned how to structure the code in MVC pattern in the express framework and I learned about the view engine, and it was the first time to work with the view engine. I also learned how to use routes to connect to the controller and also more CSS.
